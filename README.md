# Why?

This is for the offline Nimmer, **people stuck offline on a plane**, 
people with poor connectivity, that may only have few minutes of internet in a while,
people that only get good internet at school or work, people in rural areas, 
people on certain countries where other popular programming languages are intentionally blocked to download,
people with no free time to keep up with the latest new package,
or if you just want to get important packages because you can.
